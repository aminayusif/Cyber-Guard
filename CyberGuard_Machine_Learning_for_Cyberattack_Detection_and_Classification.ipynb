        "In todayâ€™s digital era, cyber threats are evolving rapidly, making traditional defense mechanisms increasingly inadequate. Organizations are now seeking intelligent, data-driven solutions to identify, classify, and mitigate cybersecurity threats in real time. This project, titled \"CyberGuard: Machine Learning for Cyberattack Detection and Classification,\" applies machine learning (ML) techniques to network and system-level data to automatically detect and classify different types of cyberattacks.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset used contains 40,000 labeled records of cybersecurity events, including features such as IP addresses, ports, protocols, payload data, anomaly scores, and metadata from firewall and intrusion detection systems. The primary objective is to develop a classification model that can predict the attack type based on these features, and optionally assess its severity level.\n",
        "\n",
        "The project follows a complete ML pipeline, beginning with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in attack behavior, protocol usage, and severity trends. In the data preprocessing phase, we handle missing values (particularly in logs such as IDS alerts and proxy information), encode categorical variables, and reduce high-cardinality fields that may lead to overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Feature engineering includes transforming timestamps into useful temporal features, encoding traffic types and protocols, and identifying significant indicators from anomaly scores. We then experiment with multiple supervised classification algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting, using grid search and cross-validation for optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        "Model evaluation is conducted using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC. Confusion matrices and error analysis help interpret the model's performance and pinpoint common misclassifications, aiding in iterative improvements.\n",
        "\n",
        "The final output is a trained ML model capable of identifying and classifying cyberattacks, which could be integrated into security systems for automated detection. The project not only demonstrates the practical use of machine learning in cybersecurity but also highlights the importance of combining domain knowledge with data science to build intelligent defense mechanisms.\n",
        "\n",
        "This solution can help cybersecurity teams improve response times, reduce false positives, and better allocate resources in the face of increasingly sophisticated threats."
